        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Korean Fried Chicken is a popular dish known for its crispy exterior and savory, often spicy, marinade. It's typically<br>served with a variety of dipping sauces, such as soy sauce, vinegar, and chili flakes. One of the most distinctive<br>features of Korean fried chicken is the "double-frying" method, which results in an extra-crunchy texture.</p>
